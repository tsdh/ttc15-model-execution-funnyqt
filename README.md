# The FunnyQT Solution to the TTC 2015 Model Execution Case

This project contains the [FunnyQT](http://funnyqt.org) solution to the
[TTC](http://www.transformation-tool-contest.eu/)
[Model Execution Case](https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/moliz/source/browse/?repo=ttc2015).

## Usage

To run the solution's test suite which executes the activities of all provided
test models, you need to get the `lein` script from the
[Leiningen homepage](http://leiningen.org/) and put in on your `PATH`.  Then
just run `lein test`.

Leiningen will automatically fetch all required dependencies such as Clojure
and FunnyQT and install them into your local maven repository.
